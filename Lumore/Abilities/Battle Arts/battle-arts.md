# Battle Arts

## Introduction
Aura. 
The strength of one's soul. 
Many warriors have tried to master this power, but few have. Those that have a talent for this power have transformed this "energy" into the powerful weapons they can utilize called battle arts.

The first recorded battle arts were developed in tandum with the story of the *Original Spirits*. The first beings were few. Some were able to harness the power of nature and became early magic users, able to bend natural properies to their whims. Others jealous of this power, tried to imitate but failed. Uran, the God of Honor, noticed their shortcomings and sent a messenger to deliver a divine message. 

To the Lost, He spoke:
"Worry not the uncoming of nature, for it is power not meant for all.
Instead search your being inward, for there is a resting beast.
Train and subdue this beast and reach unfound realms.
For this is My law."

Hearing this, they began to train themselves. During this training some began to feel the beast He spoke of, the power of the soul. Many understood of this power and became able to perform amazing physical feats. Of the many, some individuals still felt longing for nature's allure and began to mimic its reign. These individuals, accounted below, formed their soul's power, aura, based off of the *Eight Original Spirits*:

__Ukaos__, the giant, admired the Great March's thunderous path. He mimiced it and developed the *Over March Series*, a series of running forms that can shake the earth.
__Shautius__, the human, favored the Low Tide's crahsing wave. She copied it and developed the *Tidal Abyss Series*, a series of waves that can devour the lands.
__Eldrien__, the elf, honored the Raging Breath's diastarous presence. He studied it and developed the *Raging Zephyr Series*, a series of breaths that can bringforth untold power.
__Dwaoria__, the lizardkin, revered the Ancestor's cleansing flames. She mimiced it and developed the *Noble Lineage Series*, a series of forms that can recall her origin.
__Gabryell__, the fairy, was drawn to the Purecrown's blinding allure. He mimiced it and developed the *Shining Crown Series*, a series of lights that can illuminate the dark.
__Yeselui__, the orc, feared the Nightwalker's shadow steps. She mimiced it and developed the *Twilight Walk Series*, a series of steps that can enshroud the earth.
__Bhasith__, the dwarf, recognized the Hidden Expanse's allgrowing power. He mimiced it and developed the *Final Expansion Series*, a series of blows that can reshape the earth.
__Jerilla__, the ogre, respected the Watcher's evervigilant gaze. He mimiced it and developed the *Pharid Eye Series*, a series of visual forms that can discern all.
