### Chapter 4: World of Light 
The Beginning was Here, and The End was There.

Here, The Beginning chose to bring about a bright and pure existence. He created a vast world with smooth mounts and soft airs. Golden bodies that run under ivory arches. He thought of pure entities and allowed them to inherit the world, spreading amongst themselves. He proclaimed the world as Bahhana, the First Realm of The Almighty. He then covered it with the Supreme One's Seal, bathing it in eternality.

### Chapter 5: Prayers of the Spirits
The Beginning then sought to create a secondary existence. He made a particular world with undefined edges yet open skies. He divided his work into groups. He thought of shapeless beings and gave them the world as their origin. He claimed the world as Teorlan, the Second Realm of Spirits. He then placed in it an Original Being, worthy of His love.

### Chapter 6: Land of Myths
The Beginning was asked to bring up an existence for some of His oldest creations. He created an innate world with beautiful peaks and rolling lands. The fresh bodies he poured brought life to thickened forests. He opened it to only certain beings and they made the lands their own. He called the world Borealis, the Third Realm of Myths. He then gave it to his lesser selves.

### Chapter 7: The Mortal Realm
Where They meet, both touched and brought about an empty space. The Beginning shed it light, and The End took it away. The Beginning started it with wide skies, and The End drowned it in never ending waves. The Beginning filled it with high reaching mountains and lush lands, and The End carved it, making deep cracks in its surface, dark and devoid of His Light. The Beginning brought into it souls of balance, and The End spawned carnivorous souls. It was deemed Esteria, the Middle Realm of Mortals, which They saw as good.

### Chapter 8: The Forsakened
The End needed an isolated and container of an existence. She made an unformed world with no edge and no end. She banished undesirable things to its plane. She denoted the world as Jathal, the Fourth Realm of The Forsaken. She then commanded Her lessers to watch.

### Chapter 9: A Place of Unknown
The End made another existence. She saw nothing and made nothing. She titled the world was Ulrith, the Fifth Realm of The Lost. She then removed it from her presence.

### Chapter 10: Hell Dwelleth on Sin
There, The End wanted a dark and blighted existence. She formed a deep world voided of light and purity. She birthed calamitous beings that took the world and ravaged it. She said the world was Shogrinn, the Last Realm of The Astrayed. She then released the Mark of The End, blacking it from annihilation.

Thus, the Great Realms were formed.


## Book of Magic
Magic is the power of inputting a certain amount and type of mana and outputting it as a spell. Magic is based on 8 basic elements: earth, water, air, fire, light, dark, space, and time. Simple spells are cast with just one element, but higher difficulty spells are multi elemental.

According to ancient legends:
When the realm was originally formed, the Gods born *8 Original Spirits* to lay claim to the *8 True Elements* that were used for the realms creation. There was __Terros the Great March__, __Aquos the Low Tide__, __Galos the Raging Breath__, __Ignios the Dragon Ancestor__, __Luxos the Purecrown__, __Oblos the Nightwalker__, __Banos the Hidden Expanse__, and __Horos the First Watcher__.

__Terros the Great March__ was a bull spirit. His given domain ranged from the top of mountains to the deepest of caves. His constant forming and crushing led to the land we know today. Thus, Earth Magic was formed.

__Aquos the Low Tide__ was a whale spirit. Her protecting of the raging seas led to the vast life and vibrant ocean we know today. Thus, Water Magic was given.

__Galos the Raging Breath__ was a hawk spirit. Her patrol of the skies brought upon the immerse sky we know today. Thus, Air Magic was created.

__Ignios the Dragon Ancestor__ was a lizard spirit. His resting within the hottest layers of the land led to the passionate flames we know today. Thus, Fire Magic was forged.

__Luxos the Purecrown__ was a deer spirit. His care of the great forests let multitudes of ecosystems flourish. Thus, Light Magic was passed.

__Oblos the Nightwalker__ was a wolf spirit. His lurking within the shadowy realms allowed for the day and night be so distinguished. Thus, Dark Magic was risen.

__Banos the Hidden Expanse__ was a worm spirit. His claim of the vast depths of the underground gave origination to the deepest caverns explored today. Thus, Space Magic was found.

__Horos the First Watcher__ was a spider spirit. Her gaze upon all the world's paths kept our time normal. Without this watching, our time would least to exist. Thus, Time Magic was known.

The magic known today is derived from this story.

## Book of Battle
Aura. 
The strength of one's soul. 
Many warriors have tried to master this power, but few have. Those that have a talent for this power have transformed this "energy" into the powerful weapons they can utilize called battle arts.

The first recorded battle arts were developed in tandum with the story of the *Original Spirits*. The first beings were few. Some were able to harness the power of nature and became early magic users, able to bend natural properies to their whims. Others jealous of this power, tried to imitate but failed. Uran, the God of Honor, noticed their shortcomings and sent a messenger to deliver a divine message. 

To the Lost, He spoke:
"Worry not the uncoming of nature, for it is power not meant for all.
Instead search your being inward, for there is a resting beast.
Train and subdue this beast and reach unfound realms.
For this is My law."

Hearing this, they began to train themselves. During this training some began to feel the beast He spoke of, the power of the soul. Many understood of this power and became able to perform amazing physical feats. Of the many, some individuals still felt longing for nature's allure and began to mimic its reign. These individuals, accounted below, formed their soul's power, aura, based off of the *Eight Original Spirits*:

__Ukaos__, the giant, admired the Great March's thunderous path. He mimiced it and developed the *Over March Series*, a series of running forms that can shake the earth.
__Shautius__, the human, favored the Low Tide's crahsing wave. She copied it and developed the *Tidal Abyss Series*, a series of waves that can devour the lands.
__Eldrien__, the elf, honored the Raging Breath's diastarous presence. He studied it and developed the *Raging Zephyr Series*, a series of breaths that can bringforth untold power.
__Dwaoria__, the lizardkin, revered the Ancestor's cleansing flames. She mimiced it and developed the *Noble Lineage Series*, a series of forms that can recall her origin.
__Gabryell__, the fairy, was drawn to the Purecrown's blinding allure. He mimiced it and developed the *Shining Crown Series*, a series of lights that can illuminate the dark.
__Yeselui__, the orc, feared the Nightwalker's shadow steps. She mimiced it and developed the *Twilight Walk Series*, a series of steps that can enshroud the earth.
__Bhasith__, the dwarf, recognized the Hidden Expanse's allgrowing power. He mimiced it and developed the *Final Expansion Series*, a series of blows that can reshape the earth.
__Jerilla__, the ogre, respected the Watcher's evervigilant gaze. He mimiced it and developed the *Pharid Eye Series*, a series of visual forms that can discern all.
